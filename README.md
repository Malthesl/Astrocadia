# Astrocadia

A small arcade game based in space.

The assets are from the v1.0 of this project, made in 2019. Which I found, and I liked the idea I was working on, so here is what will become version 2.0.

### Progress

Missing things / My To-Do:
- Enemies
- Level content
    - Enemy spawning: timings, waves, where
    - Goal conditions
    - Environment settings
- Shop, including more ships with different abilities and customization
